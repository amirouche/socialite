## Getting started

## Contributing

Before coding install `pre-commit` as git hook using the following
command:

```sh
cp pre-commit .git/hooks/
```

If you want to force a commit (you need a good reason to do that) use
commit with the `-n` option e.g. `git commit -n`.

Also don't forget to install developement dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```
